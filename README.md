# http2fcgi
> Quickly serve any `FastCGI` based application with no hassle.

This is a fork of [alash3al/http2fcgi](https://github.com/alash3al/http2fcgi) which removes everything except basic fastcgi transport functionality. It doesn't serve files or indexes, check file paths, look at extensions, etc.

To run, if `http2fcgi` is in your current directory, type:

`./http2fcgi`

That will create a gateway that listens for HTTP on port 6065, and will forward as fastcgi to a unix socket called `fcgi.sock` in the current directory. See below for how to customize these.
